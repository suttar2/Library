Library for The Odin Project:
    Hello there. My name is johncrops and this project is a webpage that lets users track and update their collection of books. I built this project as part of the curriculum for The Odin Project www.theodinproject.com
    
Motivation:
    I was seeking to expand my knowledge of js, page elements, higher order functions and the DOM. I also needed some practice with flexBox and flexGrid

Build status:
    It runs and works. Though it does not store data locally. I may attempt to add local storage in a future update

How to use:
    Just enter information about your book in the fields provided and press add book.

Contribute:
